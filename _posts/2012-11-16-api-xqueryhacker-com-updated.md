Due to popular demand (well, 3 people including me), I've updated [api.xqueryhacker.com][1] with the function reference for MarkLogic 6. 

I also spent a bit of time tidying up [the code][2], using url rewriting has cleaned it up a lot and the import is much simpler since I found out MarkLogic include the raw XML in the [zip download of all docs][3].
