This blog is now running on [GitHub][1] using [Jekyll][2]. It's a really nice and simple system, posts are written in markdown and Jekyll automatically generates html pages whenever I commit to [the repo][3]. No more wordpress, php, mysql or apache! The only downside is it doesn't have a comment system built in. I'll have to look at the options like disqus and see if I can import all the comments people have made over the last 4 years.

Now all I have to do is actually write some posts :)
