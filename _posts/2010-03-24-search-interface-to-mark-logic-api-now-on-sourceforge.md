Update: The project has now moved to github.  
<http://github.com/robwhitby/MarkLogic-API-Interface>

The search interface I built to the Mark Logic API (see [Searching the Mark Logic API function reference with Mark Logic][1]) is now hosted on SourceForge for anyone to download and run locally.

<http://mlapi.sourceforge.net>

Try it out here: <http://api.xqueryhacker.com>

It requires [Mark Logic Server][2] v4 (community edition is fine, it’s only small). There’s a few steps to the installation, instuctions are in a readme file in the download. Please let me know if there are any problems and I’ll try to help.
