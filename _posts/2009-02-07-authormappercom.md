My first big project with MarkLogic went live about a month back: [AuthorMapper][1].

We loaded all [Springer][2] journal content (3m+ articles) into [MarkLogic][3] and used lib-search as a basis for a faceted search interface. Using [Googleâ€™s geocoding service][4] we store the long/lat coordinates of the authors enabling plotting the results on the Google map. The JavaScript framework [Ext JS][5] is used for the search form and some other nice UI tweaks like resizing the map.
