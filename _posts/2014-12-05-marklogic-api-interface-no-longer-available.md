Today I finally got around to shutting down api.xqueryhacker.com. I created it
back in 2010 to improve the usability of the MarkLogic docs, but since then
MarkLogic have revamped their [developer site][ds] and there's really no value
in my alternate interface now.

If you really miss it then you can always host it yourself, the project is on [GitHub][gh].
