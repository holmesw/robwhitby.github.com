  XQuery support in Notepad++ XQuery 1.0
  and MarkLogic 4.1 update

I’ve finally updated the [Notepad++][1] language definition for [XQuery 1.0][2] and [MarkLogic 4.1][3]. It adds XQuery to the language menu, and enables syntax highlighting and auto-complete of XQuery 1.0, as well as the MarkLogic 4.1 API (including the library modules).

And it comes with a new bonus feature – support for the [Function List Plugin][4] by Jens Lorenz. See the readme file in the download for instructions (it’s easy).

There are still some limitations, but as far as I know this is all that’s out there right now. If anyone knows of a better implementation please let me know!
