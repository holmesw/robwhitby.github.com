UPDATE: A new version for XQuery 1.0 and MarkLogic 4.1 is available here:  
[XQuery support in Notepad++ XQuery 1.0 and MarkLogic 4.1 update][1]

I’ve been struggling to find the best development setup for working with MarkLogic and XQuery. None of the standard text editors or IDEs I tried have support for the XQuery language. I prefer to use lightweight editors rather than resource hogs like like Visual Studio, XML Spy, Eclipse etc. so I set about adding XQuery support to my current favourite [Notepad++][2], which handily supports defining custom languages.

It adds syntax highlighting and auto-complete of W3C and MarkLogic xquery functions. It’s based on ML 3.2, and I’ll update it at some point for 4.0 if/when we upgrade and I need to do it…
